# Real Time Monument Recognition Tour Guide System

• Applied SIFT algorithm to extract features from images and group the features into a bag-of-words using K-means
clustering to prepare a vocabulary of features used for classification.

• Prepared a training set using the linear SVM algorithm to classify the monuments into different classes achieving
an accuracy of about 91.81%.
